# AI-Spec-Driven Technical Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-first, AI-native Development
All content and functionality begin with detailed specifications; Every feature follows a structured, AI-assisted development process; Documentation and implementation are developed in parallel with mutual consistency.

### Technical Accuracy and Verifiability
All content must be factually accurate and scientifically valid; Code examples must be tested and reproducible; Claims must be supported by evidence or clearly marked as theoretical.

### Clarity for Developers and AI Practitioners
Content must be accessible to both novice and experienced practitioners; Technical concepts should be explained with practical examples; Code samples should be well-documented and follow best practices.

### Reproducibility and Maintainability
All examples and demonstrations must be reproducible by readers; Systems and processes must be designed for long-term maintenance; Version control and dependency management are mandatory.

### Embedded RAG Excellence
The chatbot must provide accurate answers solely from book content; User-selected text functionality must be reliable and efficient; Context limitations must be clearly communicated when insufficient.

## Engineering Standards

### Clean Architecture and Modular Design
Systems must follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns; Components must be loosely coupled and highly cohesive; Interface contracts must be well-defined and stable.

### Configuration Management
All configurations must be managed via environment variables; Secrets and sensitive data must never be hardcoded; Configuration validation must occur at application startup.

### Deployment and Infrastructure
Book must be deployable to GitHub Pages with automated builds; Infrastructure as code must be used where applicable; All deployment processes must be documented and reproducible.

### Repository Organization
Repository must include comprehensive README with setup instructions; Architecture overview must be clearly documented; Contribution guidelines must be provided.

## Development Workflow

### Content Creation Process
Technical content must follow Docusaurus standards using Spec-Kit Plus; Chapters must include objectives, explanations, and executable examples; Peer review is required for all substantial content changes.

### Code Quality Standards
All code examples must be tested and verified for accuracy; Security scanning must be performed on all dependencies; Performance benchmarks must be established for critical components.

### Testing and Validation
Automated tests must cover all core functionality; Manual testing must verify user experience flows; Acceptance criteria must be defined before implementation begins.

## Governance

This constitution governs all aspects of the AI-Spec-Driven Technical Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot project. All development activities, code contributions, and content additions must comply with these principles. Changes to this constitution require documented justification and approval from project maintainers. All pull requests must demonstrate compliance with these principles during review.
