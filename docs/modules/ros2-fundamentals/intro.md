# Introduction to ROS 2 Fundamentals

Welcome to Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2). This module is designed for AI and software students entering robotics, providing you with the essential concepts and practical skills needed to work with ROS 2 in Physical AI applications.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll gain expertise in three critical areas:

1. **ROS 2 Fundamentals** - Understanding the core concepts of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services, and messages
2. **Python Control with rclpy** - Creating ROS 2 nodes in Python and connecting AI logic to robot controllers
3. **Humanoid Structure with URDF** - Modeling humanoid robots using the Unified Robot Description Format

## Why ROS 2 Matters in Physical AI

ROS 2 serves as the middleware for humanoid robot control, acting as a robotic nervous system that coordinates communication between different components of your robotic system. Understanding ROS 2 is essential for anyone looking to develop complex, intelligent robotic systems that interact with the physical world.

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have basic programming knowledge (particularly in Python) and fundamental computer science concepts. No prior robotics experience is required, though it will be helpful as you progress.

## Getting Started

Navigate through each chapter in sequence to build a solid foundation in ROS 2 concepts before moving on to more advanced topics. Each chapter includes learning objectives, explanations, practical examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding.
