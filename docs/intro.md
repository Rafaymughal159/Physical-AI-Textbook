# Introduction

Welcome to the Physical AI Textbook, your comprehensive guide to bridging artificial intelligence and robotics. This textbook focuses on creating intelligent, embodied systems that can interact with the physical world through robotics.

## About this Book

This book is designed for AI and software students entering robotics, with a particular focus on:

- Physical AI concepts and implementations
- Robot operating systems (specifically ROS 2)
- Integration of AI algorithms with physical systems
- Control theory for embodied agents
- Sensor fusion and perception in physical contexts

Each module builds upon fundamental concepts with practical applications, ensuring you gain both theoretical understanding and hands-on experience.

## Modules

This textbook is organized into multiple modules, each focusing on a critical aspect of Physical AI:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Understanding how ROS 2 functions as middleware for humanoid robot control
- More modules coming soon...

Begin with Module 1 to understand the foundational concepts of ROS 2 in Physical AI applications.
