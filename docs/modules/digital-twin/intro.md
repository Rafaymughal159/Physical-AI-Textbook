# Introduction to Digital Twin Technology

Welcome to Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity). This module focuses on creating digital twins for humanoid robots, covering physics-based simulation, high-fidelity visual rendering, and sensor simulation for AI training applications.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll gain expertise in three critical areas:

1. **Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Creating realistic physics environments with world building, gravity, and collision detection
2. **High-Fidelity Interaction with Unity** - Developing visually realistic environments and human-robot interaction scenarios
3. **Sensor Simulation** - Implementing LiDAR, depth cameras, and IMUs for perception testing and AI training

## Why Digital Twins Matter in Robotics

Digital twins are virtual replicas of physical systems that allow engineers and researchers to test, validate, and optimize robot behaviors in a safe, controlled environment before deploying on real hardware. In robotics, digital twins serve as:

- **Safe testing environments** for complex robot behaviors
- **Cost-effective alternatives** to expensive physical prototypes
- **Training grounds** for AI models before real-world deployment
- **Validation tools** for control algorithms and sensor fusion

## Prerequisites

This module assumes you have a basic understanding of robotics concepts and have completed Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals). While not strictly required, familiarity with simulation concepts will enhance your learning experience.

## Getting Started

Navigate through each chapter in sequence to build a solid foundation in digital twin technologies before moving on to more advanced topics. Each chapter includes learning objectives, explanations, practical examples, and exercises to reinforce your understanding.
