# Implementation Plan: Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

**Branch**: `001-vla-module` | **Date**: 2026-02-09 | **Spec**: specs/001-vla-module/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-vla-module/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the implementation of Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for the Docusaurus-based technical book. The module will cover the integration of perception, language, and action to translate natural language into robot behavior, focusing on voice-to-action pipelines, LLM-based planning, and an end-to-end autonomous humanoid system overview. The approach is concept-focused and simulation-first, targeting AI and robotics students.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Docusaurus (JavaScript/TypeScript for framework), Python for conceptual code examples in chapters.
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, OpenAI Whisper (conceptual), ROS 2 (conceptual), LLMs (conceptual).
**Storage**: Files (Markdown, images, potentially code snippets) within the Docusaurus `docs/` structure.
**Testing**: Docusaurus build validation, markdown linting, conceptual verification of VLA pipelines.
**Target Platform**: Web (static site generated by Docusaurus). Simulation environment for robot concepts.
**Project Type**: Documentation/Book.
**Performance Goals**: Fast Docusaurus site generation and rendering, clear and concise explanations for readers.
**Constraints**: Markdown, Docusaurus-compatible, concept-focused, simulation-first. No production-scale LLM systems or real-world humanoid deployment.
**Scale/Scope**: A new top-level module (Module 4) with three chapters, integrated into the existing Docusaurus documentation structure.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **Spec-first, AI-native Development**: All content and functionality begin with detailed specifications; Every feature follows a structured, AI-assisted development process; Documentation and implementation are developed in parallel with mutual consistency.
- [x] **Technical Accuracy and Verifiability**: All content must be factually accurate and scientifically valid; Code examples must be tested and reproducible; Claims must be supported by evidence or clearly marked as theoretical.
- [x] **Clarity for Developers and AI Practitioners**: Content must be accessible to both novice and experienced practitioners; Technical concepts should be explained with practical examples; Code samples should be well-documented and follow best practices.
- [x] **Reproducibility and Maintainability**: All examples and demonstrations must be reproducible by readers; Systems and processes must be designed for long-term maintenance; Version control and dependency management are mandatory.
- [x] **Embedded RAG Excellence**: The chatbot must provide accurate answers solely from book content; User-selected text functionality must be reliable and efficient; Context limitations must be clearly communicated when insufficient.
- [x] **Clean Architecture and Modular Design**: Systems must follow clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns; Components must be loosely coupled and highly cohesive; Interface contracts must be well-defined and stable.
- [x] **Configuration Management**: All configurations must be managed via environment variables; Secrets and sensitive data must never be hardcoded; Configuration validation must occur at application startup.
- [x] **Deployment and Infrastructure**: Book must be deployable to GitHub Pages with automated builds; Infrastructure as code must be used where applicable; All deployment processes must be documented and reproducible.
- [x] **Repository Organization**: Repository must include comprehensive README with setup instructions; Architecture overview must be clearly documented; Contribution guidelines must be provided.
- [x] **Content Creation Process**: Technical content must follow Docusaurus standards using Spec-Kit Plus; Chapters must include objectives, explanations, and executable examples; Peer review is required for all substantial content changes.
- [x] **Code Quality Standards**: All code examples must be tested and verified for accuracy; Security scanning must be performed on all dependencies; Performance benchmarks must be established for critical components.
- [x] **Testing and Validation**: Automated tests must cover all core functionality; Manual testing must verify user experience flows; Acceptance criteria must be defined before implementation begins.

sidebars.js # To integrate the new module into Docusaurus navigation
```

**Structure Decision**: The chosen structure extends the existing Docusaurus `docs/` directory with a new `001-vla-module` subdirectory containing the three chapter markdown files. The `sidebars.js` file will be updated to include this new module in the documentation navigation.
